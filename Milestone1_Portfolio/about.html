                <p>
                    If you want to know more about me, read on.<br>
                    I have ever since my early teens been interested in computers and technology. When I was 12
                    years old, I got my first computer, an Commodore Amiga 500.<br>
                    By that time, all my time in front of the computer was spent on playing games, but as the
                    years
                    went by, I got more and more curious about how the computer worked and how software was
                    made.
                    When I began at the gymnasium (high school) I chose to study electronics, with focus on
                    computers. I got to know more about a computer's hardware, but I also had my first
                    contact with programming.<br>
                    During this time, programming languages like BASIC, Pascal and Assembler were popular, and I
                    learned the basics of coding in these languages. This was also the time when Internet became
                    more popular and became every man's property.<br>
                    Everybody was buying a modem and started
                    subscriptions with ISP's, and so did I. This was how I found interest for HTML and it didn't
                    take long until I created my first simple website.</p>
                <p>
                    After high school I was participating in an EU project which led to that I was living in London,
                    England
                    for
                    a year.<br>
                    After returning to Sweden, I started a new course learning computer networking and worked
                    much
                    with Windows NT Server and later Windows 2000.<br>
                    Unfortunately the market for network administrators were filled by the time I was finished and
                    I
                    had to work with other stuff that was far away from computers for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    During this time my family life started so with a wife and two kids I didn't have much time
                    to
                    focus on my interest for computers and programming.<br>
                    However, now when my oldest son has become a teenager he has shown the same interest for
                    computers as I had when I was young, so now I have the opportunity to share my interest with
                    him and this also has made me come back to my passion for coding.
                    So the latest year I have been studying programming on my own, primary in Python but also
                    the
                    basics in all three C languages (C, C# and C++).<br>
                    Not long after this I felt an urge that this is what I want to work with, and I also found
                    out
                    that there was a need for fullstack web developers.
                    So I started to learn web development, both frontend and backend.<br>
                    Everything I have learned this far has fallen naturally easy for me and I have enjoyed every
                    minute of it.<br>
                    As a Python programmer and a fullstack web developer I feel that I have found my calling in
                    life
                    and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.<br>
                    I am eager to start work with this professionally and I am open for any opportunities that
                    may
                    come my way.</p>
